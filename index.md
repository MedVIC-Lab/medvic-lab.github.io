## About

Recent advances in imaging data acquisition and the momentum in modern machine intelligence have led to exciting research into exploiting the power of images and solving problems that cannot be solved by manual analysis. Extracting and understanding information from images requires a multifaceted paradigm that leverages the complementarity of low-level image processing and high-level vision and machine learning approaches.

## Research Interests

 My research is at the intersection of image analysis and statistical machine learning, with an emphasis on probabilistic modeling and deep learning and a focus on clinical and biomedical applications of image-based computational methods.

As well, I am fascinated with the implications of advances in these fields for society and industry. Meanwhile, I enjoy collaborating with scientists and domain experts of different disciplines and backgrounds to conduct interdisciplinary research projects.
