# About Krithika Iyer

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, working under the guidance of Dr. Shireen Elhabian. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering from Maharashtra Institute of Technology, University of Pune. After completing my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable experience as an Associate System Engineer at IBM Global Business Services. 

My research focuses on machine learning, probabilistic modeling, deep learning, and statistical shape modeling. I am particularly passionate about exploring the applications of these areas in healthcare, aiming to contribute to advancements in diagnosis and treatment.
