# Statistical Shape Modeling of Biventricular Anatomy with Shared Boundaries


The unique shape changes of the complex anatomical structures consisting of multiple organs with a shared boundary are not captured when the organs are modeled individually. Therefore, this work aims to develop (a) simple and effective shape modeling tools for extracting shared boundary surfaces and (b) a correspondence-based optimization scheme to parameterize multi-organ anatomies and their shared surfaces consistently.
