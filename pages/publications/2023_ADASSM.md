# ADASSM: Adversarial Data Augmentation in Statistical Shape Models From Images
This paper introduces a novel strategy for on-
the-fly data augmentation for the Image-to-SSM framework by leveraging
data-dependent noise generation or texture augmentation. The proposed
framework is trained as an adversary to the Image-to-SSM network, aug-
menting diverse and challenging noisy samples. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy by encouraging the model to focus on the underlying
geometry rather than relying solely on pixel values.
