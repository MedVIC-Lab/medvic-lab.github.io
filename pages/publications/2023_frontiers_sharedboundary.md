# Statistical Shape Modeling of Multi-Organ Anatomies with Shared Boundaries: A Data-Driven Approach

This work focuses on particle-based shape modeling (PSM), a state-of-art SSM approach for building shape models by optimizing the position of correspondence particles. The proposed PSM strategy for handling shared boundaries entails (a) detecting and extracting the shared boundary surface and contour (outline of the surface mesh/isoline) of the meshes of the two organs, (b) followed by a formulation for a correspondence-based optimization algorithm to build a multi-organ anatomy statistical shape model that captures morphological and alignment changes of individual organs and their shared boundary surfaces throughout the population.

We demonstrate the shared boundary pipeline using a toy dataset of parameterized shapes and a clinical dataset of the biventricular heart models. The shared boundary model for the cardiac biventricular data achieves consistent parameterization of the shared surface (interventricular septum) and identifies the curvature of the interventricular septum as pathological shape differences.
