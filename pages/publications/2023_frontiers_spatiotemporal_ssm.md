# Learning Spatiotemporal Statistical Shape Models for Non-Linear Dynamic Anatomies

We present a principled approach to spatiotemporal SSM that relaxes these assumptions to correctly capture population-level shape variation over time. We propose to incorporate modeling the underlying time dependency into correspondence optimization via a regularized principal component polynomial regression. This approach is flexible enough to capture non-linear temporal dynamics while encoding population-specific spatial regularity. We demonstrate our methodâ€™s efficacy on synthetic data and left atrium segmented from cardiac MRI scans. Our approach better captures the population modes of variation and a statistically significant time dependency than existing methods.
