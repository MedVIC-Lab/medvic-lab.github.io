# Benchmarking Off-the-shelf Statistical Shape Modeling Tools in Clinical Applications

Current evaluations predominantly focus on non-clinical domains, leaving a gap in understanding the applicability of SSM techniques in real-world clinical scenarios. We aim to conduct comprehensive evaluation and validation studies to assess the precision and reliability of SSM tools for clinical tasks such as landmark/measurement estimation and lesion screening across multiple datasets.
