# From Images to Probabilistic Anatomical Shapes: A Deep Variational Bottleneck Approach
In this paper, we propose a principled framework based on the variational information bottleneck theory to relax these assumptions while predicting probabilistic shapes of anatomy directly from images without supervised encoding of shape descriptors. Here, the latent representation is learned in the context of the learning task, resulting in a more scalable, flexible model that better captures data non-linearity. Additionally, this model is self-regularized and generalizes better given limited training data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method provides improved accuracy and better calibrated aleatoric uncertainty estimates than state-of-the-art methods.
